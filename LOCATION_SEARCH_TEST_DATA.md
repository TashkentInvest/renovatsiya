**Format:** Decimal degrees with 7-digit precision**Coordinate System:** WGS84 (EPSG:4326)**Region:** Tashkent, Uzbekistan**All coordinates verified on:** December 9, 2025---If slower, likely a map performance issue (not location search).- **Total:** <300ms from Enter key to marker visible- **Toast show:** <50ms (immediate)- **Map update:** <200ms (quick)- **Parse time:** <5ms (instant)Using these coordinates, expect:## Performance Baseline---4. Check browser console for URL parsing errors3. For maps.app.goo.gl URLs: expand them first2. Try shorter test decimal coordinates first1. Ensure full URL (starts with https://)**If URLs don't work:**4. Try decimal format first to isolate issue3. Check cardinal directions (N, S, E, W)2. Check special characters are present (°, ', ")1. Copy exactly from "DMS Coordinates" section above**If DMS coordinates don't work:**5. Check browser console for errors (F12)4. Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)3. Check both numbers are present2. Check no extra spaces1. Check you have comma separator (not period)**If decimal coordinates don't work:**## Troubleshooting the Test---If your coordinates are outside these ranges, they won't work.| **Tashkent Actual** | 68.2° | 70.0° || **Tashkent Actual** | 39.3° | 43.0° || **Longitude** | 68.0° | 71.0° || **Latitude** | 39.0° | 43.0° ||---|---|---|| | Min | Max |All these coordinates are within these bounds:## Reference Map Bounds---✅ Do: `69.2740783, 41.3639259` (reversed order auto-detects)✅ Do: `41.3639259 69.2740783` (space works too)✅ Do: `41.3639259, 69.2740783` (proper format)❌ Don't: `41.36, 69.27°` (degree symbol after number)❌ Don't: `N41.36, E69.27` (direction before number)❌ Don't: `41.36; 69.27` (semicolon separator)❌ Don't: `41.36, 69.27,` (trailing comma)## Common Mistakes to Avoid---- [ ] Coordinates are accurate (can verify against Google Maps)- [ ] Zoom level is around 17 (street level)- [ ] Marker location looks reasonable for Tashkent- [ ] Toast notification appears (orange then green)- [ ] Map zooms to show the location- [ ] Each coordinate shows a marker on the mapUsing these test coordinates, verify:## Quick Validation Checklist---   - Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds   - Message: "Joylashuv topildi: [lat], [lng]"4. **Success toast:** Green notification   - Popup shows lat/lng when clicked   - Shows exact coordinate location3. **Visual marker:** Orange pin appears   - Zoom level: 17   - View centers on coordinates2. **Within 1 second:** Map updates   - Message: Depends on input type   - Color: Orange (processing)1. **Immediate:** Toast notification appearsWhen you enter any of these coordinates correctly:## Expected Results---- Tests multi-service support- Alternative map service✅ Test with Yandex URL### 7. Try Yandex Maps (Final Test)- Tests URL parsing- Realistic use case✅ Test with full Google Maps URL from above### 6. Try URL Format (Most Real-World)- Special characters required- Most complex parsing✅ Test with: `41°21'50.93"N, 69°16'25.67"E`### 5. Try DMS Format (Hardest)- Tests validation across region- Ensures system works across map✅ Test each location in "Famous Locations" section### 4. Try Multiple Coordinates- Tests order detection logic- System auto-detects which is lat/lng✅ Test with: `69.2740783, 41.3639259`### 3. Try Reversed Order (Auto-detection)- Different separator- Same coordinates✅ Test with: `41.3639259 69.2740783` (space-separated)### 2. Try Next (Slightly Harder)- Easy to verify if working- No special characters- Simple decimal format✅ Test with: `41.3639259, 69.2740783`### 1.
